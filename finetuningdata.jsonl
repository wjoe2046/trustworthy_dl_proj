{"prompt": "Given the context 'Patient: Pharmacists maintain that doctors should not be permitted to sell the medicine that they prescribe because doctors would then be tempted to prescribe unnecessary medicines in order to earn extra income. But pharmacists have a financial interest in having a monopoly on the sale of prescription medicines, so their objection to the sale of medicines by doctors cannot be taken seriously. Explanation: The patient's argument attempts to discredit the position of pharmacists by questioning their motives, suggesting that their objection to doctors selling medicine is not based on genuine concerns for public health but rather their financial interests in having a monopoly on prescription medicine sales' and question 'The patient's argument proceeds by'.

Industry representative: The industry alone should be responsible for devising safety standards because of its expertise in handling oil and its understanding of the cost entailed. Implementing the double-hull proposal is not currently feasible because it creates new safety issues. Furthermore, the cost would be burdensome to the industry and consumers. Explanation: The environmentalist's argument relies on the assumption that the only viable options for increasing safety standards for oil tankers are either industry action or national government regulation, as the industry has refused to take action' and question 'Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument of the environmentalist depends?'.

Hence, the herb's high histidine production must be the key feature that allows it to grow in metal-rich soils. Explanation: In order to evaluate the argument that the herb's high histidine production is the key feature that allows it to grow in metal-rich soils, it would be important to determine whether other closely related plants also produce histidine in large quantities, as this would suggest that there may be another factor that allows this herb to grow in metal-rich soils' and question 'In evaluating the argument, it would be most important to determine which of the following?'.

The mints could refine gold and produced other kinds of coins that had much purer gold content, but the Senegalese gold was never refined. As a preliminary to negotiating prices, merchants selling goods often specified that payment should be in the coins minted from Senegalese gold.

Yet, after the instance of infection, antibodies take about four weeks to appear in the fish' s blood, and the test will find no results before then. Catching a live Bluetail Moonbeam and shipping it to the United States takes a little more than a week. Once the Bluetail Moonbeam is in captivity, shippers can eliminate all new sources of infection, but unfortunately, some Bluetail Moonbeams might be infected days or even hours before being caught. Thus, even running the antibody test on each Bluetail Moonbeam entering the country would still allow infected fish into the American stocks. This is because quarantining each imported Bluetail Moonbeam for at least three weeks and performing the antibody test on each before allowing the uninfected ones to move into industrial stocks would ensure that infected fish do not enter the American stocks, as antibodies take about four weeks to appear in the fish's blood after infection' and question 'Which of the following, if performed by the government, could logically be expected to overcome the problem with the plan to limit the spread of this virus in the Bluetail Moonbeam?'.

However, burglar alarm systems, unlike car alarm systems, are effective in deterring burglaries, so the only acceptable solution is to fine burglar alarm system owners the cost of 45 minutes of police time for each false alarm their systems generate. Explanation: The statement that burglar alarm systems, unlike car alarm systems, are effective in deterring burglaries provides a reason why fining owners of burglar alarm systems for false alarms is the only acceptable solution, as it acknowledges the importance of burglar alarm systems' and question 'The statement that burglar alarm systems, unlike car alarm systems, are effective in deterring burglaries plays which one of the following roles in the argument?'.

We can ttherefore conclude that more people will be buying angora items of clothing this year than they did in previous years. Explanation: The study mentioned in option 1 is not directly related to angora clothing, option 2 provides evidence that people who buy cashmere also buy angora, option 3 suggests that there may not be an increase in angora purchases due to the similarity between cashmere and angora, while option 4 contradicts the initial claim by stating that angora production has also been affected' and question 'Which of the following, if true, best supports the claim that more people will be buying angora clothing this year?'.

Prior to 1700, pilings were driven to \"refusal, \" that is, to the point at which they refused to go any deeper. In a 1588 inquiry into the solidity of piers for Venice' s Rialto Bridge, it was determined that the bridge' s builder, Antonio Da Ponte, had met the contemporary standard for refusal: he had caused the pilings to be driven until additional penetration into the ground was no greater than two inches after twenty-four hammer blows. This inference can be drawn from the fact that the passage states that the pilings were driven until they refused to go any deeper, indicating that there was potential for them to be driven deeper even after the standard of refusal had been met, making it possible for the pilings of the Rialto Bridge to have been driven deeper' and question 'Which one of the following can properly be inferred from the passage?'.

Nevertheless, worldwide fertilizer use has declined by 6 percent between 1985 and the present. Explanation: This option suggests that the increased fertilizer use between 1950 and 1985 may have been responsible for the sharp increase in farmland productivity, but eventually, the effect of adding more fertilizer to the soil diminished, leading to a decrease in fertilizer use since 1985, despite farmers seeking to increase productivity further' and question 'Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above?'.

After the experiment, a measurable amount of helium-4 gas was found in the air of the chamber. The experimenters cited this evidence in support of their conclusion that fusion had been achieved. Explanation: The experimenters' conclusion is based on the presence of measurable helium-4 gas in the chamber's air, so if the amount of helium-4 found in the chamber's air did not exceed the amount of helium-4 that is found in ordinary air, this would suggest that the helium-4 gas could have come from a source other than fusion, casting doubt on their conclusion' and question 'Which one of the following, if true, would cast doubt on the experimenters' conclusion?'.

{"prompt": "Given the context 'Ethicist: Studies have documented the capacity of placebos to reduce pain in patients who believe that they are receiving beneficial drugs. Some doctors say that they administer placebos because medically effective treatment reinforced by the placebo effect sometimes helps patients recover faster than good treatment alone. But administering placebos is nonetheless ethically questionable, for even if a placebo benefits a patient, a doctor might, for example, have prescribed it just to give the patient satisfaction that something was being done.

The cost of producing the sneakers in exotic prints is no greater than that of producing them in more traditional colors, so de los Santos could earn a higher profit per unit by producing a greater percentage of his sneakers in such prints. The logic used to arrive at this answer is that the conclusion suggests that producing more sneakers in exotic prints would result in a higher profit per unit, but this conclusion assumes that consumers' willingness to pay higher prices for the exotic sneakers was not influenced by the relative scarcity of those sneakers' and question 'Which of the following is an assumption made in drawing the conclusion above?'.

{"prompt": "Given the context 'Complaints that milk bottlers take enormous markups on the bottled milk sold to consumers are most likely to arise when least warranted by the actual spread between the price that bottlers pay for raw milk and the price at which they sell bottled milk. The complaints occur when the bottled-milk price rises, yet these price increases most often merely reflect the rising price of the raw milk that bottlers buy from dairy farmers. When the raw-milk price is rising, the bottlers' markups are actually smallest proportionate to the retail price. When the raw-milk price is falling, however, the markups are greatest. Explanation: Since the passage clearly states that when the raw-milk price is falling, the bottlers' markups are actually greatest proportionate to the retail price, it follows that bottlers generally do not respond to a decrease in raw-milk prices by straightaway proportionately lowering the price of the bottled milk they sell' and question 'If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true on the basis of them?'.

Granting that Sauk is more imitator than innovator, and that he maintained political views very different from those Providence maintained, it has yet to be shown that these facts make his writings any less subtly or powerfully crafted than those of his more esteemed mentor.

This reluctance is exacerbated by the fact that the average income is significantly lower than it was five years ago. Thus, even though it is not a perfect solution, if the government were to lower income taxes, the economy would improve. Explanation: The economist's argument relies on the assumption that consumers' reluctance to spend is directly related to income taxes, and that lowering income taxes will decrease this reluctance and result in increased consumer spending' and question 'Which one of the following is an assumption required by the economist's argument?'.

This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain. Explanation: The option 'A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition' weakens the conclusion that small magnets are effective at relieving back pain, as the patients in the first group could have reported reduction in pain due to their awareness of receiving treatment, rather than the magnets being effective in reducing the pain' and question 'Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?'.

The biologist hypothesized that the prevalence of this tree in the prehistoric rainforest accounts for the other plants' failure to remove larger amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Explanation: If the trees currently found in the rainforest are largely hybrids and a product of crossbreeding that occurred in the late twentieth century, then the biologist's hypothesis regarding the prevalence of a certain tree in the prehistoric rainforest accounting for other plants' failure to remove larger amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere would not stand as the prehistoric rainforest would have had a different composition of trees' and question 'Which of the following, if true, would most seriously undermine the biologist's hypothesis?'.

If, however, the milk reaches that temperature through exposure to a conventional heat source of 50 degrees Celsius, it will contain nearly all of its initial concentration of the enzyme. Ttherefore, what destroys the enzyme is not heat but microwaves, which generate heat. Explanation: This answer weakens the argument by suggesting that the reason microwaved milk had less lysozyme may not be due to the microwaves themselves, but rather due to the fact that the microwave heats the milk more quickly and unevenly than a conventional heat source, leading to the destruction of lysozyme' and question 'Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?'.

When molten rocks crystallize, they display the polarity of Earth' s magnetic field at that time. But the recrystallized rocks recovered at the site display normal magnetic polarity, even though Earth' s magnetic field was reversed at the time of the mass extinction.

{"prompt": "Given the context 'Scott: The Hippocratic oath demands, specifically, that doctors \"never divulge\" information about patients. Hence the psychiatrist who released tapes of a poet' s therapy sessions after the poet' s death violated his oath by his actions, even though the tapes were released after the poet' s death and to the poet' s official biographer. It makes no difference that the poet' s published works were written in a confessional manner or that she had assured the psychiatrist that he could do with the tapes as he saw fit. Bonara: 1 agree that doctors are bound not to divulge patient information and would not myself release such tapes without written permission from the patient. Nevertheless, I disagree that the circumstances were irrelevant in this case. I do not think the poet' s psychiatrist violated the Hippocratic oath. Explanation: Scott's evaluation of the psychiatrist's actions is based on the principle that doctors are bound not to divulge patient information, regardless of the circumstances, because violating patient confidentiality could undermine other patients' trust in their psychiatrists' and question 'Which one of the following principles, if established, helps most to justify Scott's evaluation of the psychiatrist's actions?'.

In many years insect pollinators are scarce, and in those years a typical non-self-pollinating primrose produces fewer seeds than does a typical self-pollinating primrose. In other years, seed production is approximately equal. Thus, self-pollinating primroses have the advantage of higher average seed production. Aside from seed production, these self-pollinating primroses are indistinguishable from non-self-pollinating primroses. Nevertheless, self-pollinating primrose plants remain rare among primroses.

The explanation of this discrepancy is that the proportion of jobs offering such a disability benefit has greatly increased in recent years. The reasoning is that if most employer plans stop disability benefit payments at the usual retirement age of 65, then the proportion of adults receiving disability benefit payments in the age range of 65-74 being lower may not solely be due to an increase in jobs offering disability benefits, but rather because of the cutoff age' and question 'Which one of the following, if true about East Wendell, shows that the explanation above is at best incomplete?'.

For one month, workers at Plant A received free nutritious breakfasts every day before work, while workers in Plant B did not. The productivity of Plant A' s workers increased, while that of Plant B' s workers did not.

The two books, although set in different periods and regions, contain enough plot similarities to make coincidental resemblance unlikely. Mikkeli' s defense rests on his argument that plagiarism was impossible in this case because Halden' s book has been published only in Norwegian, a language Mikkeli does not understand, and because no reviews of Halden' s book have ever been published. This is because Mikkeli's defense rests on the assumption that he did not have knowledge of the plot of Halden's book before writing his own, and option 1, 2, and 3 do not address this assumption, while option 4 is irrelevant' and question 'The argument in Mikkeli's defense depends on the assumption that'.

Since pollutants are known to impair marine mammals' ability to fight off viral infection, it is likely that the higher death rate among the Baltic seals was due to the higher levels of pollutants in their blood. This statement directly reinforces the argument by showing that the high death rate due to viral diseases is not limited to seals, but extends to other marine mammals in the Baltic Sea, indicating that the higher levels of pollutants in the Baltic Sea likely affect various marine organisms similarly' and question 'Which one of the following, if true, provides the most additional support for the argument?'.

The top 10 percent of the workers in each group are rewarded and the bottom 10 percent are penalized or fired. But this system is unfair to workers. Good workers could receive low rankings merely because they belong to groups of exceptionally good workers.

{"prompt": "Given the context 'The only physical factor preventing a human journey to Mars has been weight. Carrying enough fuel to propel a conventional spacecraft to Mars and back would make even the lightest craft too heavy to be launched from Earth. A device has recently been invented, however, that allows an otherwise conventional spacecraft to refill the craft' s fuel tanks with fuel manufactured from the Martian atmosphere for the return trip. Ttherefore, it is possible for people to go to Mars in a spacecraft that carries this device and then return. The argument relies on the assumption that the device for manufacturing fuel from the Martian atmosphere weighs less than the tanks of fuel a conventional spacecraft would need to carry from Earth for the return trip, as the premise specifically states that weight has been the limiting factor preventing a human journey to Mars' and question 'Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?'.

Explanation: The professor's statement implies that great authors often use language in innovative and idiosyncratic ways that do not adhere strictly to proper usage, suggesting that those with the greatest talent for using a language are not as likely to observe proper usage as others' and question 'The Professor's statements, if true, most support which one of the following?'. Give your answer as a number where 0, 1, 2 and 3 refers to the first, second, thirdand fourth option in the answer list respectively.", "completion": "1"}
{"prompt": "Given the context 'Professor Donnelly' s exams are always more difficult than Professor Curtis' s exams. The question about dinosaurs was on Professor Donnelly' s last exam. Ttherefore, the question must be difficult. Explanation: The argument in option 2 exhibits both the logical flaws of assuming that a more complicated plot must necessarily be very complex and that a poem from a better book of poetry must necessarily be good' and question 'Which one of the following exhibits both of the logical flaws exhibited in the argument above?'. Give your answer as a number where 0, 1, 2 and 3 refers to the first, second, thirdand fourth option in the answer list respectively.", "completion": "2"}
{"prompt": "Given the context 'Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. The flawed pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is similar to that in the fourth option, where a decline in business expansions is assumed to be solely caused by high taxes without considering other factors that could also contribute to this decline' and question 'The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?'. Give your answer as a number where 0, 1, 2 and 3 refers to the first, second, thirdand fourth option in the answer list respectively.", "completion": "3"}
{"prompt": "Given the context 'Columnist: George Orwell' s book 1984 has exercised much influence on a great number of this newspaper' s readers. One thousand readers were surveyed and asked to name the one book that had the most influence on their lives. The book chosen most often was the Bible; 1984 was second. Explanation: Knowing how many people chose books other than 1984 would help determine whether the influence of 1984 was significant, or if it was simply one of many influential books' and question 'The answer to which one of the following questions would most help in evaluating the columnist's argument?'. Give your answer as a number where 0, 1, 2 and 3 refers to the first, second, thirdand fourth option in the answer list respectively.", "completion": "1"}
{"prompt": "Given the context 'Critic: Emily Dickinson' s poetry demonstrates that meaning cannot reside entirely within a poem itself, but is always the unique result of an interaction between a reader' s system of beliefs and the poem; and, of course, any two readers from different cultures or eras have radically different systems of beliefs. Explanation: If each reader's system of beliefs is unique and different, it is not likely that a modern reader and a nineteenth-century reader would interpret one of Shakespeare's sonnets in the same way because their systems of beliefs would differ due to the cultural and historical gaps' and question 'If the critic's statements are true, each of the following could be true EXCEPT:'. Give your answer as a number where 0, 1, 2 and 3 refers to the first, second, thirdand fourth option in the answer list respectively.", "completion": "2"}
{"prompt": "Given the context 'Scientists removed all viruses from a seawater sample and then measured the growth rate of the plankton population in the water. They expected the rate to increase dramatically, but the population actually got smaller. Plankton and viruses in seawater compete for some of the same nutrients' and question 'Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the unexpected result described above?'. Give your answer as a number where 0, 1, 2 and 3 refers to the first, second, thirdand fourth option in the answer list respectively.", "completion": "2"}
{"prompt": "Given the context 'The more television children watch, the less competent they are in mathematical knowledge. More than a third of children in the United States watch television for more than five hours a day; in South Korea the figure is only 7 percent. But whereas less than 15 percent of children in the United States understand advanced measurement and geometric concepts, 40 percent of South Korean children are competent in these areas. Ttherefore, if United States children are to do well in mathematics, they must watch less television. The argument assumes that the instruction in advanced measurement and geometric concepts available to children in the United States is not substantially better than that available to South Korean children, as this would suggest that the problem lies solely with the resources available and not with the amount of television being watched by children' and question 'Which one of the following is an assumption upon which the argument depends?'. Give your answer as a number where 0, 1, 2 and 3 refers to the first, second, thirdand fourth option in the answer list respectively.", "completion": "3"}
