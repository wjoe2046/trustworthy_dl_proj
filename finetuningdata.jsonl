{"prompt": "Given the context 'Numismatist: In medieval Spain, most gold coins were minted from gold mined in West Africa, in the area that is now Senegal. The gold mined in this region was the purest known.

The mints could refine gold and produced other kinds of coins that had much purer gold content, but the Senegalese gold was never refined. As a preliminary to negotiating prices, merchants selling goods often specified that payment should be in the coins minted from Senegalese gold. The preference for coins minted from Senegalese gold can be explained by the fact that refined gold varied considerably in purity, which means specifying a price as a number of refined-gold coins did not fix the quantity of gold received in payment' and question 'Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain this preference?'.

An infectious virus has been threatening Bluetail Moonbeam stocks in the United States. Even before a Bluetail Moonbeam develops any symptoms, biologists can establish the presence of the infection by an inexpensive test for antibodies in the fish' s blood. Yet, after the instance of infection, antibodies take about four weeks to appear in the fish' s blood, and the test will find no results before then. Catching a live Bluetail Moonbeam and shipping it to the United States takes a little more than a week. Once the Bluetail Moonbeam is in captivity, shippers can eliminate all new sources of infection, but unfortunately, some Bluetail Moonbeams might be infected days or even hours before being caught. Thus, even running the antibody test on each Bluetail Moonbeam entering the country would still allow infected fish into the American stocks.

{"prompt": "Given the context 'Of every 100 burglar alarms police answer, 99 are false alarms. This situation causes an enormous and dangerous drain on increasingly scarce public resources. Each false alarm wastes an average of 45 minutes of police time. As a result police are consistently taken away from responding to other legitimate calls for service, and a disproportionate share of police service goes to alarm system users, who are mostly businesses and affluent homeowners. However, burglar alarm systems, unlike car alarm systems, are effective in deterring burglaries, so the only acceptable solution is to fine burglar alarm system owners the cost of 45 minutes of police time for each false alarm their systems generate. Explanation: The statement that burglar alarm systems, unlike car alarm systems, are effective in deterring burglaries provides a reason why fining owners of burglar alarm systems for false alarms is the only acceptable solution, as it acknowledges the importance of burglar alarm systems' and question 'The statement that burglar alarm systems, unlike car alarm systems, are effective in deterring burglaries plays which one of the following roles in the argument?'.

The explanation of this discrepancy is that the proportion of jobs offering such a disability benefit has greatly increased in recent years. The reasoning is that if most employer plans stop disability benefit payments at the usual retirement age of 65, then the proportion of adults receiving disability benefit payments in the age range of 65-74 being lower may not solely be due to an increase in jobs offering disability benefits, but rather because of the cutoff age' and question 'Which one of the following, if true about East Wendell, shows that the explanation above is at best incomplete?'.

{"prompt": "Given the context 'Professor Donnelly' s exams are always more difficult than Professor Curtis' s exams. The question about dinosaurs was on Professor Donnelly' s last exam. Ttherefore, the question must be difficult. Explanation: The argument in option 2 exhibits both the logical flaws of assuming that a more complicated plot must necessarily be very complex and that a poem from a better book of poetry must necessarily be good' and question 'Which one of the following exhibits both of the logical flaws exhibited in the argument above?'. Please choose the correct answer among a list of answers given: ['Mathematics is more difficult than history. Ttherefore, my calculus test will be more difficult than my history test.', \"Shield's first novel has a more complicated plot than any other that she has written. Hence, that plot must be very complex.\", \"Porter's new book of poetry is better than any of her other books of poetry. This poem is from Porter's new book, so it must be good.\", \"Lewis is a better baker than Stockman. Lewis made this cake. Ttherefore, it must be better than most of Stockman's cakes.\"].

{"prompt": "Given the context 'Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. The flawed pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is similar to that in the fourth option, where a decline in business expansions is assumed to be solely caused by high taxes without considering other factors that could also contribute to this decline' and question 'The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?'. Please choose the correct answer among a list of answers given: ['Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.', 'Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.', 'Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.', 'When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.'].

{"prompt": "Given the context 'Columnist: George Orwell' s book 1984 has exercised much influence on a great number of this newspaper' s readers. One thousand readers were surveyed and asked to name the one book that had the most influence on their lives. The book chosen most often was the Bible; 1984 was second. Explanation: Knowing how many people chose books other than 1984 would help determine whether the influence of 1984 was significant, or if it was simply one of many influential books' and question 'The answer to which one of the following questions would most help in evaluating the columnist's argument?'. Please choose the correct answer among a list of answers given: ['How many books had each person surveyed read?', 'How many people chose books other than 1984?', \"How many people read the columnist's newspaper?\", 'How many of those surveyed had actually read the books they chose?'].

{"prompt": "Given the context 'Critic: Emily Dickinson' s poetry demonstrates that meaning cannot reside entirely within a poem itself, but is always the unique result of an interaction between a reader' s system of beliefs and the poem; and, of course, any two readers from different cultures or eras have radically different systems of beliefs. Explanation: If each reader's system of beliefs is unique and different, it is not likely that a modern reader and a nineteenth-century reader would interpret one of Shakespeare's sonnets in the same way because their systems of beliefs would differ due to the cultural and historical gaps' and question 'If the critic's statements are true, each of the following could be true EXCEPT:'. Please choose the correct answer among a list of answers given: [\"A reader's interpretation of a poem by Dickinson is affected by someone else's interpretation of it.\", \"A reader's enjoyment of a poem is enhanced by knowing the poet's interpretation of it.\", \"A modern reader and a nineteenth-century reader interpret one of Shakespeare's sonnets in the same way.\", \"A reader's interpretation of a poem evolves over time.\"].

{"prompt": "Given the context 'The more television children watch, the less competent they are in mathematical knowledge. More than a third of children in the United States watch television for more than five hours a day; in South Korea the figure is only 7 percent. But whereas less than 15 percent of children in the United States understand advanced measurement and geometric concepts, 40 percent of South Korean children are competent in these areas. Ttherefore, if United States children are to do well in mathematics, they must watch less television. The argument assumes that the instruction in advanced measurement and geometric concepts available to children in the United States is not substantially better than that available to South Korean children, as this would suggest that the problem lies solely with the resources available and not with the amount of television being watched by children' and question 'Which one of the following is an assumption upon which the argument depends?'. Please choose the correct answer among a list of answers given: [\"A child's ability in advanced measurement and geometry increases if he or she watches less than one hour of television a day.\", 'South Korean children are more disciplined about doing schoolwork than are children in the United States.', 'Children in the United States are less interested in advanced measurement and geometric concepts than are South Korean children.', 'The instruction in advanced measurement and geometric concepts available to children in the United States is not substantially worse than that available to South Korean children.'].
