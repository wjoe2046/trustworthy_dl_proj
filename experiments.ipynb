In a study, five hemophiliac mice that are subsequently inoculated with the rabies virus, R, will be placed in a tank and will then be attacked by three other normal mice. The results of this study may show that R is lethal in hemophilus mice and may be very helpful in developing a rabies shot that is effective against hemophiliac humans.

They have offered an organics certification to a process that has been shown to destroy any residual chemical fertilizers from over quite a long period of time, and which is guaranteed to bring residual levels of chemical fertilizers down to below federally established thresholds. Since organsically grown wheat is federally certified, agri-scientist Jacobson has offered to sell the Washington wheat industry's industry a 100-gram sample of wheat, which can indicate what residual chemical and biological contaminants are in the conventional wheat industry. Washington's agricultural department wants to determine whether this sample of wheat will become organically grown if the 100 grams is planted in some Colorado soil that is rich in organic matter and nitrogen which farmers use on their fields. Since Colorado is known worldwide for its high-quality super-soil, if this initial sample of wheat that is planted in Colorado soil is able to produce organically grown wheat, then the Washington State's wheat industry will market itself as organic growers. and question Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the argument? choosing the correct answer among a list of answers in ['The organic growers of Washington's wheat industry should have to meet new federal eligibility standards for receiving the incentive payments for producing organically grown wheat.', 'Washington wheat industry should have their wheat certified organic based\"}, {'id': 'train_2376', 'correct_answer': 2, 'gpt3_answer': \" Go to question 2\\n\\nQuestion 2: Anna: In a theory about the explanation for the development of some type of behavior in primates, Jim repeatedly makes declarations of the following sort: if I change certain data by exchanging certain defining versions of some theoretical entity in this theory to be one kind it can be, for a different kind it can be, then I can demonstrate that the unique combination of this data produces a result in this behavior that cannot be feasibly explained by any currently accepted explanation for this type of behavior.

If a person is rejected for a job, that person must have the experience that best matches the position in order to get the job. It is essential that a job go to the applicant who is best suited for it. If a job is not given to the best applicant, the outcome is poor. In this situation probably the best person did not get the job, so this is a poor outcome. Therefore, whoever was rejected for the job probably has the experience that best matches the position.
