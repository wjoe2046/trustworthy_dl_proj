Industry representative: The industry alone should be responsible for devising safety standards because of its expertise in handling oil and its understanding of the cost entailed. Implementing the double-hull proposal is not currently feasible because it creates new safety issues. Furthermore, the cost would be burdensome to the industry and consumers."

Catching a live Bluetail Moonbeam and shipping it to the United States takes a little more than a week. Once the Bluetail Moonbeam is in captivity, shippers can eliminate all new sources of infection, but unfortunately, some Bluetail Moonbeams might be infected days or even hours before being caught.

And those who don' t commit violent crimes have no inclination to do so. Rather than impose harsh mandatory sentences, we should attend to the root causes of violence to reduce the rate of violent crime. Suarez: Would you say the same about nonviolent crimes, such as tax evasion? Surely mandatory penalties are a useful deterrent in these cases. At any rate, I am confident that mandatory sentences prevent most people who would otherwise physically harm others from doing so."

This answer option provides a logical explanation for why stopping production of unprofitable chocolate candies may not necessarily make the entire company more profitable.

Explanation: This option provides a possible explanation for the scientists' belief that the asteroid strike caused extinction, despite their result that most debris settled too soon for the plants to disappear or the dinosaurs to freeze. Specifically, if the debris cloud caused a significant decrease in sunlight, it would lead to a decrease in temperature on the earth's surface, which could have contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs.

In other words, if the overall number of musicians has increased despite the reduction in the average number of musicians per band, it is probable that some professional bands have increased the number of musicians they employ.

The lack of convergence in heart-disease rates between France and the United States despite the narrowing difference in regular red-wine consumption could be due to the fact that per-capita consumption of saturated fats has increased somewhat in France over the past 30 years, while it has remained essentially unchanged in the United States. This suggests that the impact of red wine on reducing heart disease risk may be outweighed by the negative effects of a high saturated fat diet.

        "context": "A survey has shown that public perceptions of comparative risks differ radically from the assessments of risk-management experts. For example, living near a nuclear power plant was judged a much greater risk by the survey respondents than it was by the experts. On the other hand, exposure to X-rays was judged a significantly lower risk by the survey respondents than it was by the experts. Psychologists have found that people tend to be more worried about risks they consider involuntary than about risks they consider voluntary. Thus the survey results were probably caused by the respondents' tendency to consider involuntary risks to be greater than they actually are."

It then establishes that if those in the former group follow the directive to treat others as they themselves want to be treated, there will be implications for their behavior. The missing piece of information is what these implications are. Answer option 2 provides a logical conclusion by stating that those in the former group may treat those in the latter group in a way they dislike because of their different preferences. This conclusion is consistent with the two groups' differences in preferences and with the principle of treating others as one wants to be treated since members of the former group would also dislike having information they prefer concealed from them, whereas members of the latter group have disclosed their preference for facing the truth.",

Explanation: The fact that new paperwork and procedures have allowed the human resources department to process and close almost all new claims of sexual harassment in less than one month may account for the apparent reduction in the number of open cases, rather than the effectiveness of the CEO's Advisory Team guidelines. This weakens the conclusion that the guidelines were effective in reducing the occurrence of new sexual harassment claims at Harrison's Technologies.

Since water that contains 250 or more milligrams of dissolved salt per liter tastes unacceptably salty, continuing the salting of Albritten' s roads at its present rate will render Albritten' s groundwater unpalatable within the next few decades."

        "answers": [
            "Poor organization of information in a news story makes it impossible to understand the information.",
            "Being exposed to more broadcast news stories within a given day would help a person to better understand the news.",
            "It is not the number of broadcast news stories to which a person is exposed that is the source of the feeling of confusion.",
            "Some people are being overwhelmed by too much information."
        ],
        "context": "Most people feel that they are being confused by the information from broadcast news. This could be the effect of the information' s being delivered too quickly or of its being poorly organized. Analysis of the information content of a typical broadcast news story shows that news stories are far lower in information density than the maximum information density with which most people can cope at any one time. So the information in typical broadcast news stories is poorly organized."
