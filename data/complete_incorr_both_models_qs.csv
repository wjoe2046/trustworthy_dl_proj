But no expert is certain of being able to solve someone else' s problem. Patrick wants to devise a solution to his own behavioral problem.,0,90,1
train_58,The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it,"['fails to address the possibility that an approach that works with one kind of audience will not work with another', 'takes for granted that both scholars and politicians have persuasion as their aim', 'fails to account for the difficulty of coming up with charitable formulations of positions to which one is opposed', 'focuses on the differences between two styles of argumentation even though those styles might be suited to similar audiences']",0,"When politicians describe their opponents' positions, they typically make those positions seem implausible and unattractive. In contrast, scholars try to make opposing positions seem as plausible and attractive as possible. Doing so makes their arguments against those positions more persuasive to their professional colleagues. Politicians should take note: they could persuade more voters with their arguments if they simply followed the scholars in charitably formulating their opponents' positions.",1,80,3

train_222,The dialogue between Huang and Suarez most strongly supports the claim that they disagree about whether,"['mandatory sentences will deter most people who might otherwise commit violent crimes', 'the best way to reduce violent crime is to address the root causes of violence', 'people who commit violent crimes carefully consider how they will be punished for their crimes', 'severe penalties reduce the incidence of tax evasion']",0,"Huang: Most people who commit violent crimes do not carefully consider whether or how they will be punished for these crimes. And those who don' t commit violent crimes have no inclination to do so. Rather than impose harsh mandatory sentences, we should attend to the root causes of violence to reduce the rate of violent crime. Suarez: Would you say the same about nonviolent crimes, such as tax evasion? Surely mandatory penalties are a useful deterrent in these cases.

Siduria recently implemented a program to convert heating systems from oil to natural gas. Siduria already produces more natural gas each year than it burns, and oil production in Sidurian oil fields is increasing at a steady pace. If these trends in fuel production and usage continue, ttherefore, Sidurian reliance on foreign sources for fuel should decline soon.",1,80,1

Since biologists agree that frogs are definitely related to the species of fish from which human beings evolved, on the basis of a close match between the mitochondrial DNA of lungfish and that of frogs Dr. Stevens-Hoyt claims that this ancestor must be lungfish. Dr. Grover, on the other hand, contends that mitochondrial DNA evolves too rapidly to be a reliable indicator of relationships between species over long periods of time, and citing the close chemical match between the hemoglobin of coelacanths (a saltwater fish) and that of tadpoles, claims that human beings must be descended from coelacanths.",0,95,0

train_4476,"Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?","['Over the course of the lessons, the first-graders who showed greater improvement in their ability to write letters automatically also generally showed greater improvement in their composition skills.', 'The first-graders who wrote letters the most automatically before receiving the after-school lessons in handwriting showed the greatest improvement in their composition skills over the course of the lessons.', 'Among the first-graders who received the lessons in handwriting, those who started out with strong composition skills showed substantial improvement in how automatically they could write letters.', 'Before receiving the after-school lessons in handwriting, the 100 first-graders who received the lessons were representative of first-graders more generally, with respect to their skills in both handwriting and composition.']",0,Researchers gave 100 first-graders after-school lessons in handwriting. They found that those whose composition skills had improved the most had learned to write letters the most automatically. This suggests that producing characters more automatically frees up mental resources for other activities.,1,80,1

Before the reorganization, the sales force was organized geographically, with some sales representatives concentrating on city-center businesses and others concentrating on different outlying regions. The reorganization attempted to increase the sales representatives' knowledge of clients' businesses by having each sales representative deal with only one type of industry or of retailing. After the reorganization, advertising sales increased.",1,90,1

However, a warbler sings a special song when it molts (sheds its feathers). Other yellow warblers will not enter the smaller core territory of a yellow warbler singing its molting song.
